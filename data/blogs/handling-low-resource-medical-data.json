  "content": "## Context\nMedical datasets are rarely large, clean, or balanced. In many healthcare contexts, data scarcity is structural rather than temporary.\n\nDespite this, many machine learning pipelines implicitly assume large-scale, well-curated datasets. This mismatch leads to brittle systems and misleading performance claims.\n\n## Problem Statement\nSmall datasets amplify bias, variance, and overfitting. Class imbalance further distorts evaluation and model behavior.\n\nThe challenge is not merely training models, but extracting reliable signal from limited, imperfect data.\n\n## Why More Data Is Not the Answer\nBlindly increasing dataset size through naive augmentation often degrades semantic consistency.\n\nMore data does not guarantee better generalization if it fails to reflect real-world variability.\n\n## Design Principles\n- Error analysis before augmentation\n- Feature-level reasoning\n- Class-aware metrics\n\n## Technical Approach\nWe begin by analyzing failure modes and per-class behavior. Augmentation strategies are applied selectively and evaluated rigorously.\n\nIn several cases, feature-space synthesis outperformed raw data augmentation by preserving clinical relevance.\n\n## Evaluation\nPerformance is measured per class and across edge cases. Confidence calibration and robustness are prioritized.\n\n## Limitations\nGeneralization remains bounded by dataset diversity. No technique fully compensates for missing clinical variability.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nIn low-resource settings, robustness and interpretability matter more than raw performance.\n\n## Conclusion\nLow-resource machine learning requires different success criteria. Restraint and rigor are essential."
