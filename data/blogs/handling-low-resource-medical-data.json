  "content": "## Context\nMedical data scarcity is the norm, not the exception.\n\n## Problem Statement\nSmall, biased datasets make standard training paradigms unreliable.\n\n## Why More Data Is Not the Answer\nSynthetic volume without semantic consistency degrades performance.\n\n## Design Principles\n- Error analysis first\n- Feature-level augmentation\n- Class-aware evaluation\n\n## Technical Approach\nWe analyze failure modes before applying augmentation strategies.\n\n## Evaluation\nPerformance is measured per-class, not globally.\n\n## Limitations\nGeneralization remains bounded by data diversity.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nRobustness beats leaderboard metrics.\n\n## Conclusion\nLow-resource ML requires different success criteria."
