  "content": "## Context\nCardiac assessment relies on multiple complementary signals, including imaging, numerical indicators, and clinical context.\n\nUnimodal AI systems fail to capture this complexity.\n\n## Problem Statement\nModels trained on a single modality miss clinically relevant interactions between signals.\n\n## Design Principles\n- Representation-level fusion\n- Interpretability-first design\n\n## System Overview\nVisual embeddings from echocardiography are fused with structured clinical indicators such as ejection fraction.\n\n## Technical Choices\nFusion occurs at the representation level to preserve modality-specific structure.\n\n## Evaluation\nExplainability and confidence calibration are mandatory components of the pipeline.\n\n## Limitations\nTemporal alignment between modalities remains challenging.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nMultimodality improves robustness and mirrors clinical reasoning.\n\n## Conclusion\nCardiac intelligence is inherently multimodal and must be modeled accordingly."
