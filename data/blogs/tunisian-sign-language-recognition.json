For deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, these barriers often translate into delayed care, misunderstandings, or complete exclusion from medical dialogue.\n\nIn Tunisia, sign language resources are scarce, datasets are limited, and most existing systems are trained on unrelated sign languages under ideal conditions. This gap motivated our work on Tunisian Sign Language (TunSL) recognition.\n\n## Problem Statement\nTunSL recognition faces multiple constraints simultaneously: small datasets, severe class imbalance, uncontrolled recording environments, and the need for real-time inference on limited hardware.\n\nThe challenge is not achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, but building a system that is usable, robust, and deployable in healthcare settings.\n\n## Why Standard Vision Approaches Fail\nMost sign language recognition systems rely on end-to-end video models. These architectures are computationally heavy, data-hungry, and brittle when faced with background noise or occlusions.\n\nIn low-resource contexts, such models overfit quickly and fail to generalize. Their latency and hardware requirements further limit deployability.\n\n## Design Principles\nOur design was guided by the following principles:\n\n- Efficiency over scale\n- Robust representations over raw pixels\n- Interpretability over black-box performance\n\n## System Overview\nThe TunSL pipeline is based on skeletal keypoint extraction followed by temporal modeling. Raw video frames are converted into structured motion representations before classification.\n\nThis abstraction reduces noise, improves generalization, and dramatically lowers computational cost.\n\n## Technical Choices\nWe selected keypoint-based representations to isolate semantic motion from irrelevant visual details. Temporal encoders capture gesture dynamics without requiring long video sequences.\n\nRather than increasing dataset size blindly, we focused on preserving motion semantics during training.\n\n## Data & Evaluation\nThe dataset exhibits strong class imbalance. Instead of naive oversampling, we applied feature-space augmentation to generate plausible motion patterns.\n\nEvaluation emphasizes robustness, latency, and failure analysis rather than headline accuracy.\n\n## Limitations\nThe current system focuses on isolated gestures rather than continuous signing. Extending to continuous recognition remains an open challenge.\n\n## Deployment\nThe pipeline is designed for low-latency inference on consumer-grade devices, making it suitable for real healthcare environments.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nAccessibility-driven AI requires restraint. Simpler representations often outperform larger models under real constraints.\n\n## Conclusion\nTunSL recognition must be engineered with context in mind. Practical accessibility demands efficiency, robustness, and deployability."
