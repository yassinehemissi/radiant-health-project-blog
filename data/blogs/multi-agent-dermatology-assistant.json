  "content": "## Context\nDermatology combines visual perception, medical knowledge, and patient communication. Each dimension introduces distinct challenges.\n\nSingle-model approaches struggle to handle this complexity reliably.\n\n## Problem Statement\nEnd-to-end systems conflate perception, reasoning, and explanation. When errors occur, it is difficult to localize responsibility.\n\n## Design Principles\n- Agent specialization\n- Explicit information flow\n- Evidence grounding\n\n## System Overview\nThe system is composed of multiple agents: a vision agent for lesion detection, a retrieval agent for medical knowledge, and a synthesis agent for structured output generation.\n\nEach agent operates within a clearly defined scope.\n\n## Technical Choices\nMedical knowledge is retrieved explicitly rather than embedded implicitly. This reduces hallucinations and improves traceability.\n\nAgent boundaries enable independent evaluation and safer iteration.\n\n## Evaluation\nEach agent is evaluated separately using task-appropriate metrics. Failures are localized and analyzable.\n\n## Limitations\nThe system does not provide diagnoses. It supports orientation and documentation.\n\n## Lessons Learned\nAgent-based decomposition aligns better with clinical reasoning than monolithic intelligence.\n\n## Conclusion\nMulti-agent architectures improve transparency, safety, and maintainability in medical AI systems."
