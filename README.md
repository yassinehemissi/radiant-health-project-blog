# Radiant Blog

This repository contains the content and structure for the **Radiant Blog** — a technical publication focused on the design of **deployable, modular, and grounded AI systems**, with a strong emphasis on **healthcare**, **accessibility**, and **multimodal intelligence**.

The blog documents not just results, but **reasoning, architectural choices, constraints, failures, and lessons learned** while building real-world AI systems.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this blog is to bridge the gap between:

* AI research prototypes, and
* production-ready, trustworthy systems.

Rather than focusing on isolated models or benchmarks, Radiant emphasizes:

* system design,
* evaluation under constraints,
* interpretability and safety,
* and long-term maintainability.

## Content Philosophy

Each post follows a consistent structure designed to reflect real engineering and research workflows:

* Clear problem framing grounded in reality
* Explicit discussion of constraints and failure modes
* Modular system design over monolithic intelligence
* Honest evaluation and limitations
* Deployment as a first-class concern

Posts are written to be:

* readable by engineers,
* credible to researchers,
* and reusable as internal documentation.

## Editorial Structure

All long-form posts follow a shared structure:

1. Context
2. Problem Statement
3. Why Common Approaches Fail
4. Design Principles
5. System Overview
6. Technical Choices
7. Data & Evaluation
8. Limitations
9. Deployment Constraints
10. Lessons Learned

## Contribution Guidelines

This blog is intentionally **curated**, not open-ended.

* be system-oriented, not model-centric,
* discuss real constraints and trade-offs,
* avoid marketing language or hype,
* and include limitations and failure analysis.

Experimental results without deployment considerations are discouraged.
